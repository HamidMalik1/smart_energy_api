# Energy_Weather Forecast FMI for Uni of Oulu PV production 
Updated every one hour. 

Within this Nordic collaboration, the Finnish Meteorological Institute has begun calculating in MEPS sets (MetCoOp Ensemble Prediction System), which means conducting eight forecast runs at once instead of just a single run. The set system represents a probability forecasting system where several slightly differing forecasts are run simultaneously. The system then produces a forecast as well as an estimate on its uncertainty.
So the fractiles in the PV forecast, and how narrowly or widely they are distributed depend on how the individual forecasts in MEPS behave. The idea is that the spread becomes larger in cases when the predicted weather conditions are more uncertain (due to atmospheric dynamics).
